        <h2>More Than Just Skin Deep</h2>
            <main>

                <p>The largest barrier between the outside world and the body, skin has an important job.</p> 
                <p>Not only does skin protect the body from the elements, but the state of a person’s skin also projects what is going on internally.</p> 
                <p>A good skin care routine is simple, and the benefits may end up being surprising.</p> 
                <p>Read on for 5 benefits about skin care that may not be known.</p> 

                <h2>what is the skin’s job?</h2>
                <p>The largest organ in the human body, skin is a person’s greatest barrier against environmental forces and harmful bacteria.</p> 
                <p>Skin regulates body temperature and synthesizes vitamin D. The sense of touch is directly controlled by the skin,</p> 
                <p>and melanin provides protection from harmful sun rays.</p> 

                <h2>skin reflects health</h2>
                <p>Skin can reflect the health of an individual. Take the liver for instance. The liver works to eliminate toxins from the body. When unable to do so,</p> 
                <p>the liver will seek another way to get rid of toxins. Here is where the skin enters the picture. If liver function is impaired,</p> 
                <p>the liver will push the toxins through the skin. This can be reflected in the skin as dermatitis, eczema, liver spots, rashes, and even premature wrinkles.</p> 
                <p>Jaundice, the yellowing of the skin, is another sign the liver is not functioning properly.</p> 

                <p>Patches of dark skin, known as hyperpigmentation, are a potential sign of diabetes. Round lesions are often the beginning of the autoimmune disorder lupus.</p> 
                <p>Hives are the signal that an allergen is affecting or has entered the body. Skin not only protects the body from the outside but</p> 
                <p>also alerts doctors to what is occurring on the inside.</p> 
                <h2> 3 layers of skin</h2>
                <p>Because skin is the strongest and largest barrier against infection, proper skin care is essential.</p>
                <p>Proper skin care will keep the outermost layer intact, maintaining enough hydration in the inner layers. Skin has 3 layers:</p>
                <p>Epidermis: the outmost layer creates skin tone and provides a waterproof barrier.</p>
                <p>Dermis: the middle layer contains sweat glands, connective tissue, hair follicles, blood vessels, and nerves.</p>
                <p>Hypodermis: the innermost and thickest layer is made mostly of fat.</p>

                <h2>Benefits of good skin care</h2>
                <p>A good skin care routine helps a person’s skin to look more hydrated. Taking care of skin can also prevent wrinkles.</p>
                <p> Here are a few more benefits of a good skin care routine:</p>

                <p>A good skin care routine will reduce visible pores, wrinkles, and under eye circles.</p>
                <p>Protection from harmful sun rays will prevent sun damage, blemishes, and hyper-pigmentation.</p>
                <p>As the individual ages, the skin loses hydration, brightness, and collagen. A good skin care routine can leave skin looking healthier and younger.</p>
                <p>Over time, the skin naturally loses elasticity and can appear saggy and crepe-like. Proper skin care can restore firmness and even texture to the skin.</p>
                <p>A good skin care routine will protect from harmful bacteria and allergens, leaving the individual feeling and looking healthier.</p>
                <h2>tips and tools</h2>
                <p>People who have not established a skin care routine may not know where to start. Consulting a dermatologist will bring the most skin improvements.</p>
                <p>However, people can start creating a skin care routine at home with a few general tips. Some of these include:</p>

                <p>Face wash: A good face wash can ensure all makeup, dirt, and allergens are removed from the skin. Use a face wash in the morning, after exercise, and before bed.</p>
                <p>Sunscreen: At least 30 SPF is needed to protect against harmful sun rays.</p>
                <p>Moisturize: All skin types can benefit from a good moisturizer. Even oily skin can profit from a lightweight and oil-free moisturizer.</p>
                <p>Don’t wear makeup to bed: Going to sleep without removing makeup is a guaranteed way to wake up with blocked pores.</p>
                <p>Eat well and sleep: Eating smart and getting enough sleep will make skin look young and refreshed.</p>
                <h2>More than just skin deep</h2>
                <p>Surprising benefits of good skin care include restored firmness and even texture. Even protection from sun damage is a hidden benefit of good skin care.</p>
                <p>Good skin care is linked to better overall health, both physical and mental. People who need help establishing a good skin care routine can consult with a dermatologist.</p>
