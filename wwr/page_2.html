            <h2>Highlights from the past season</h2>
            <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon.</p>
            <p> This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth.</p>
            <p> We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family.</p>
            <p> The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, </p>
            <p>but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures).</p>
            <p> Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon.</p>
            <p>We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.</p>
            <h2>Encounters in the wild!</h2>
            <p>Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States.</p>
            <p>We share these areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself face to face with one.</p>
            <p>Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless.</p>
            <p> There are, however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. 
            <p>Scorpions can be found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment.</p>
            <p>The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States.</p>
            <p>Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily humans are not on that list!</p>
            <p>They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, spiders and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting.</p>
            <p>Relief can be found with ice, aspirin and time.When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes or sandals. 
            <p>Always have a light with you to see where you are going.</p>
            <p>Never try to capture a scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west.</p>
            <p>It is one of two species of wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision,</p>
            <p>hearing and smell that helps them detect and avoid predators.Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short with a slight curvature.</p>
            <p>Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting.If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game animals.</p>
            <p>Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.</p>
