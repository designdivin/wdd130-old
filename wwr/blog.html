                <h2>Highlights from the past season</h2>
                <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon.</p>
                <p> This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth.</p>
                <p> We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family.</p>
                <p> The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, </p>
                <p>but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures).</p>
                <p> Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon.</p>
                <p>We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Encounters in the wild!</h2>
            <p>Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share these areas</p>
            <p> with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find</p>
            <p>yourself face to face with one.</p> 

            <p>Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being harmless. There are,</p>
            <p>however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be</p> 
            <p>found in almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The scorpion that</p>
            <p>calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the</p>
            <p>United States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily</p>
            <p>humans are not on that list!</p>
                
            <p>They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, spiders</p>
            <p>and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with ice,</p>
            <p>aspirin and time.</p>
                
            <p>When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes or</p>
            <p>sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion</p>
            <p>and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.</p>
                
            <p>Big horn sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one of two species of</p>
            <p> wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur.</p>
            <p>Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that helps them</p>
            <p>detect and avoid predators.</p>
                
            <p>Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short with a</p>
            <p>slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting.</p>
                
            <p>If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 100 feet</p>
            <p>away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.</p>
